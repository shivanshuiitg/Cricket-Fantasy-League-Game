	<strong>General Instruction:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> There should be atleast 4 batsman , at least 2 bowler , at least 1 all rounder and exactly one wicket keeper in a team.<br></li>
	<br>
	<li>Scoring Criteria for batsman:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Base Score</strong> 1 point per run .The more runs your score, the more points you get.</li>
			<li><strong>Impact Score</strong> 2 points per six, -5 per duck(getting out on 0 runs).
					    In the smaller, 20 over format, six runs is a great boost in the scoring rate
						, and rewarded.Getting out without scoring is a disappointment, and penalized.</li>
			<li><strong>Milestone Score</strong> 10 points for every 25 runs
scored
Intuitively, 25, 50, 75 and 100 have been regarded
as large milestones for runs in crickets
in a given innings, and players are rewarded
for it.</li>
	<li><strong>Pace Bonus</strong> Runs scored - balls faced
Intuitively, players who hit more runs off
fewer deliveries are more valuable, and they
are rewarded thus.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Scoring Criteria for bowler:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Base Score</strong> 20 points per wicket
A wicket, or getting an opposing batsman out,
is a huge prize. Only 10 can be taken in an
innings, and each is rewarded with 20 points</li>
			<li> <strong>Impact Score</strong> 1 points per dot ball, 20 points
for a maiden over
A dot ball, or a ball where no run is scored,
is rare and is a desirable by the bowler. A
maiden over, or one segment of 6 consecutive
dot balls, is rewarded handsomely with 20
points.</li>
		<li><strong>Milestone Score</strong> 10 points for the 2nd wicket,
10 points for each subsequent wicket
Taking more than one wicket in a T20 is an
uncommon feat, and rewarded with bonuses.</li>
		<li><strong>Pace Bonus</strong> 1.5x Balls bowled - runs conceded.
If positive, it is doubled.
A bowlers goal is to concede as few runs as
possible, also known as maintaining a good
economy rate. For doing this, they are rewarded
with points, even if they fail to dismiss
a batsman.
		</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Scoring criteria for Feilders
			<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>Catches</strong> 10 points
For a player who takes a catch to dismiss a
batsman.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Stumping</strong> 15 points
For a wicketkeeper who hits the sticks with the
ball when the batsman is not within his crease,
or his safe line.</li>
				<li><strong>Direct Hit</strong> 15 points
When a fielder throws the ball from the distance
and it directly hits the sticks while the
batsmen are running, and they are not in their
safe zone, then they are rewarded points.</li>
				<li><strong>Run Out</strong> 10 points for each player involved
Similar to a direct hit, except the throw from
the distance need not directly hit the stumps.
As long as a batsman is dismissed before he
makes his ground, all fielding players involved
in throwing the ball are rewarded.</li>

			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Bonus Points
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Player of the match</strong> 25 points
The most valuable player of every match is rewarded
25 more points for his performance.</li>
				<li><strong>Victory Bonus</strong> 5 points
A player in the victorious side is rewarded
with 5 points.</li>
			
			</ul>
		</li>
